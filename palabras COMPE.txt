inputstandard input
outputstandard output
Ilya is a very clever lion, he lives in an unusual city ZooVille. In this city all the animals have their rights and obligations. Moreover, they even have their own bank accounts. The state of a bank account is an integer. The state of a bank account can be a negative number. This means that the owner of the account owes the bank money.

Ilya the Lion has recently had a birthday, so he got a lot of gifts. One of them (the gift of the main ZooVille bank) is the opportunity to delete the last digit or the digit before last from the state of his bank account no more than once. For example, if the state of Ilya's bank account is -123, then Ilya can delete the last digit and get his account balance equal to -12, also he can remove its digit before last and get the account balance equal to -13. Of course, Ilya is permitted not to use the opportunity to delete a digit from the balance.

Ilya is not very good at math, and that's why he asks you to help him maximize his bank account. Find the maximum state of the bank account that can be obtained using the bank's gift.

Input
The single line contains integer n (10 ≤ |n| ≤ 109) — the state of Ilya's bank account.

Output
In a single line print an integer — the maximum state of the bank account that Ilya can get.

Mishka is a little polar bear. As known, little bears loves spending their free time playing dice for chocolates. Once in a wonderful sunny morning, walking around blocks of ice, Mishka met her friend Chris, and they started playing the game.

Rules of the game are very simple: at first number of rounds n is defined. In every round each of the players throws a cubical dice with distinct numbers from 1 to 6 written on its faces. Player, whose value after throwing the dice is greater, wins the round. In case if player dice values are equal, no one of them is a winner.

In average, player, who won most of the rounds, is the winner of the game. In case if two players won the same number of rounds, the result of the game is draw.

Mishka is still very little and can't count wins and losses, so she asked you to watch their game and determine its result. Please help her!

Input
The first line of the input contains single integer n n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of game rounds.

The next n lines contains rounds description. i-th of them contains pair of integers mi and ci (1 ≤ mi,  ci ≤ 6) — values on dice upper face after Mishka's and Chris' throws in i-th round respectively.

Output
If Mishka is the winner of the game, print "Mishka" (without quotes) in the only line.

If Chris is the winner of the game, print "Chris" (without quotes) in the only line.

If the result of the game is draw, print "Friendship is magic!^^" (without quotes) in the only line.

Yakko, Wakko and Dot, world-famous animaniacs, decided to rest from acting in cartoons, and take a leave to travel a bit. Yakko dreamt to go to Pennsylvania, his Motherland and the Motherland of his ancestors. Wakko thought about Tasmania, its beaches, sun and sea. Dot chose Transylvania as the most mysterious and unpredictable place.

But to their great regret, the leave turned to be very short, so it will be enough to visit one of the three above named places. That's why Yakko, as the cleverest, came up with a truly genius idea: let each of the three roll an ordinary six-sided die, and the one with the highest amount of points will be the winner, and will take the other two to the place of his/her dreams.

Yakko thrown a die and got Y points, Wakko — W points. It was Dot's turn. But she didn't hurry. Dot wanted to know for sure what were her chances to visit Transylvania.

It is known that Yakko and Wakko are true gentlemen, that's why if they have the same amount of points with Dot, they will let Dot win.

Input
The only line of the input file contains two natural numbers Y and W — the results of Yakko's and Wakko's die rolls.

Output
Output the required probability in the form of irreducible fraction in format «A/B», where A — the numerator, and B — the denominator. If the required probability equals to zero, output «0/1». If the required probability equals to 1, output «1/1».

outputstandard output
Quite recently, a very smart student named Jury decided that lectures are boring, so he downloaded a game called "Black Square" on his super cool touchscreen phone.

In this game, the phone's screen is divided into four vertical strips. Each second, a black square appears on some of the strips. According to the rules of the game, Jury must use this second to touch the corresponding strip to make the square go away. As Jury is both smart and lazy, he counted that he wastes exactly ai calories on touching the i-th strip.

You've got a string s, describing the process of the game and numbers a1, a2, a3, a4. Calculate how many calories Jury needs to destroy all the squares?

Input
The first line contains four space-separated integers a1, a2, a3, a4 (0 ≤ a1, a2, a3, a4 ≤ 104).

The second line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), where the і-th character of the string equals "1", if on the i-th second of the game the square appears on the first strip, "2", if it appears on the second strip, "3", if it appears on the third strip, "4", if it appears on the fourth strip.

Print a single integer — the total number of calories that Jury wastes.

A. New Year Transportation
time limit per test2 seconds
memory limit per test256 megabytes
inputstandard input
outputstandard output
New Year is coming in Line World! In this world, there are n cells numbered by integers from 1 to n, as a 1 × n board. People live in cells. However, it was hard to move between distinct cells, because of the difficulty of escaping the cell. People wanted to meet people who live in other cells.

So, user tncks0121 has made a transportation system to move between these cells, to celebrate the New Year. First, he thought of n - 1 positive integers a1, a2, ..., an - 1. For every integer i where 1 ≤ i ≤ n - 1 the condition 1 ≤ ai ≤ n - i holds. Next, he made n - 1 portals, numbered by integers from 1 to n - 1. The i-th (1 ≤ i ≤ n - 1) portal connects cell i and cell (i + ai), and one can travel from cell i to cell (i + ai) using the i-th portal. Unfortunately, one cannot use the portal backwards, which means one cannot move from cell (i + ai) to cell i using the i-th portal. It is easy to see that because of condition 1 ≤ ai ≤ n - i one can't leave the Line World using portals.

Currently, I am standing at cell 1, and I want to go to cell t. However, I don't know whether it is possible to go there. Please determine whether I can go to cell t by only using the construted transportation system.

Input
The first line contains two space-separated integers n (3 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 104) and t (2 ≤ t ≤ n) — the number of cells, and the index of the cell which I want to go to.

The second line contains n - 1 space-separated integers a1, a2, ..., an - 1 (1 ≤ ai ≤ n - i). It is guaranteed, that using the given transportation system, one cannot leave the Line World.

Output
If I can go to cell t using the transportation system, print "YES". Otherwise, print "NO".

B. Even Array

memory limit per test256 megabytes
inputstandard input
outputstandard output
You are given an array a[0…n−1]
 of length n
 which consists of non-negative integers. Note that array indices start from zero.

An array is called good if the parity of each index matches the parity of the element at that index. More formally, an array is good if for all i
 (0≤i≤n−1
) the equality imod2=a[i]mod2
 holds, where xmod2
 is the remainder of dividing x
 by 2.

For example, the arrays [0,5,2,1
] and [0,17,0,3
] are good, and the array [2,4,6,7
] is bad, because for i=1
, the parities of i
 and a[i]
 are different: imod2=1mod2=1
, but a[i]mod2=4mod2=0
.

In one move, you can take any two elements of the array and swap them (these elements are not necessarily adjacent).

Find the minimum number of moves in which you can make the array a
 good, or say that this is not possible.

Input
The first line contains a single integer t
 (1≤t≤1000
) — the number of test cases in the test. Then t
 test cases follow.

Each test case starts with a line containing an integer n
 (1≤n≤40
) — the length of the array a
.

The next line contains n
 integers a0,a1,…,an−1
 (0≤ai≤1000
) — the initial array.

Output
For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of moves to make the given array a
 good, or -1 if this is not possible.

A prime number is a number which has exactly two distinct divisors: one and itself. For example, numbers 2, 7, 3 are prime, and 1, 6, 4 are not.

The next prime number after x is the smallest prime number greater than x. For example, the next prime number after 2 is 3, and the next prime number after 3 is 5. Note that there is exactly one next prime number after each number. So 5 is not the next prime number for 2.

One cold April morning Panoramix predicted that soon Kakofonix will break free from his straitjacket, and this will be a black day for the residents of the Gallic countryside.

Panoramix's prophecy tells that if some day Asterix and Obelix beat exactly x Roman soldiers, where x is a prime number, and next day they beat exactly y Roman soldiers, where y is the next prime number after x, then it's time to wait for Armageddon, for nothing can shut Kakofonix up while he sings his infernal song.

Yesterday the Gauls beat n Roman soldiers and it turned out that the number n was prime! Today their victims were a troop of m Romans (m > n). Determine whether the Gauls should wait for the black day after today's victory of Asterix and Obelix?

Vasya has found a strange device. On the front panel of a device there are: a red button, a blue button and a display showing some positive integer. After clicking the red button, device multiplies the displayed number by two. After clicking the blue button, device subtracts one from the number on the display. If at some point the number stops being positive, the device breaks down. The display can show arbitrarily large numbers. Initially, the display shows number n.

Bob wants to get number m on the display. What minimum number of clicks he has to make in order to achieve this result?

Input
The first and the only line of the input contains two distinct integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 104), separated by a space .

Small, but very brave, mouse Brain was not accepted to summer school of young villains. He was upset and decided to postpone his plans of taking over the world, but to become a photographer instead.

As you may know, the coolest photos are on the film (because you can specify the hashtag #film for such).

Brain took a lot of colourful pictures on colored and black-and-white film. Then he developed and translated it into a digital form. But now, color and black-and-white photos are in one folder, and to sort them, one needs to spend more than one hour!

As soon as Brain is a photographer not programmer now, he asks you to help him determine for a single photo whether it is colored or black-and-white.

Photo can be represented as a matrix sized n × m, and each element of the matrix stores a symbol indicating corresponding pixel color. There are only 6 colors:

'C' (cyan)
'M' (magenta)
'Y' (yellow)
'W' (white)
'G' (grey)
'B' (black)
The photo is considered black-and-white if it has only white, black and grey pixels in it. If there are any of cyan, magenta or yellow pixels in the photo then it is considered colored.

Input
The first line of the input contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of photo pixel matrix rows and columns respectively.

Then n lines describing matrix rows follow. Each of them contains m space-separated characters describing colors of pixels in a row. Each character in the line is one of the 'C', 'M', 'Y', 'W', 'G' or 'B'.

Output
Print the "#Black&White" (without quotes), if the photo is black-and-white and "#Color" (without quotes), if it is colored, in the only line.

outputstandard output
It is lunch time for Mole. His friend, Marmot, prepared him a nice game for lunch.

Marmot brought Mole n ordered piles of worms such that i-th pile contains ai worms. He labeled all these worms with consecutive integers: worms in first pile are labeled with numbers 1 to a1, worms in second pile are labeled with numbers a1 + 1 to a1 + a2 and so on. See the example for a better understanding.

Mole can't eat all the worms (Marmot brought a lot) and, as we all know, Mole is blind, so Marmot tells him the labels of the best juicy worms. Marmot will only give Mole a worm if Mole says correctly in which pile this worm is contained.

Poor Mole asks for your help. For all juicy worms said by Marmot, tell Mole the correct answers.

Input
The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), the number of piles.

The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 103, a1 + a2 + ... + an ≤ 106), where ai is the number of worms in the i-th pile.

The third line contains single integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 105), the number of juicy worms said by Marmot.

The fourth line contains m integers q1, q2, ..., qm (1 ≤ qi ≤ a1 + a2 + ... + an), the labels of the juicy worms.

Output
Print m lines to the standard output. The i-th line should contain an integer, representing the number of the pile where the worm labeled with the number qi is.

You have n
 gifts and you want to give all of them to children. Of course, you don't want to offend anyone, so all gifts should be equal between each other. The i
-th gift consists of ai
 candies and bi
 oranges.

During one move, you can choose some gift 1≤i≤n
 and do one of the following operations:

eat exactly one candy from this gift (decrease ai
 by one);
eat exactly one orange from this gift (decrease bi
 by one);
eat exactly one candy and exactly one orange from this gift (decrease both ai
 and bi
 by one).
Of course, you can not eat a candy or orange if it's not present in the gift (so neither ai
 nor bi
 can become less than zero).

As said above, all gifts should be equal. This means that after some sequence of moves the following two conditions should be satisfied: a1=a2=⋯=an
 and b1=b2=⋯=bn
 (and ai
 equals bi
 is not necessary).

Grigoriy, like the hero of one famous comedy film, found a job as a night security guard at the museum. At first night he received embosser and was to take stock of the whole exposition.

Embosser is a special devise that allows to "print" the text of a plastic tape. Text is printed sequentially, character by character. The device consists of a wheel with a lowercase English letters written in a circle, static pointer to the current letter and a button that print the chosen letter. At one move it's allowed to rotate the alphabetic wheel one step clockwise or counterclockwise. Initially, static pointer points to letter 'a'. Other letters are located as shown on the picture:


After Grigoriy add new item to the base he has to print its name on the plastic tape and attach it to the corresponding exhibit. It's not required to return the wheel to its initial position with pointer on the letter 'a'.

Our hero is afraid that some exhibits may become alive and start to attack him, so he wants to print the names as fast as possible. Help him, for the given string find the minimum number of rotations of the wheel required to print it.

Input
The only line of input contains the name of some exhibit — the non-empty string consisting of no more than 100 characters. It's guaranteed that the string consists of only lowercase English letters.

outputstandard output
A permutation is a sequence of integers p1, p2, ..., pn, consisting of n distinct positive integers, each of them doesn't exceed n. Let's denote the i-th element of permutation p as pi. We'll call number n the size of permutation p1, p2, ..., pn.

Nickolas adores permutations. He likes some permutations more than the others. He calls such permutations perfect. A perfect permutation is such permutation p that for any i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) (n is the permutation size) the following equations hold ppi = i and pi ≠ i. Nickolas asks you to print any perfect permutation of size n for the given n.

Input
A single line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the permutation size.

Output
If a perfect permutation of size n doesn't exist, print a single integer -1. Otherwise print n distinct integers from 1 to n, p1, p2, ..., pn — permutation p, that is perfect. Separate printed numbers by whitespaces.

 and the value ∑i=1n−1|ai−ai+1|
 is the maximum possible. Recall that |x|
 is the absolute value of x

outputstandard output
Casimir has a string s
 which consists of capital Latin letters 'A', 'B', and 'C' only. Each turn he can choose to do one of the two following actions:

he can either erase exactly one letter 'A' and exactly one letter 'B' from arbitrary places of the string (these letters don't have to be adjacent);
or he can erase exactly one letter 'B' and exactly one letter 'C' from arbitrary places in the string (these letters don't have to be adjacent).
Therefore, each turn the length of the string is decreased exactly by 2
. All turns are independent so for each turn, Casimir can choose any of two possible actions.

For example, with s
 =
 "ABCABC" he can obtain a string s
 =
 "ACBC" in one turn (by erasing the first occurrence of 'B' and the second occurrence of 'A'). There are also many other options for a turn aside from this particular example.

For a given string s
 determine whether there is a sequence of actions leading to an empty string. In other words, Casimir's goal is to erase all letters from the string. Is there a way to do this?

 (1≤t≤1000
) — the number of test cases.

Each test case is described by one string s
, for which you need to determine if it can be fully erased by some sequence of turns. The string s
 consists of capital letters 'A', 'B', 'C' and has a length from 1
 to 50
 letters, inclusive.

Output
Print t
 lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should be YES if there is a way to fully erase the corresponding string and NO otherwise.

You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answers).

You are given a positive integer x
. Find any such 2
 positive integers a
 and b
 such that GCD(a,b)+LCM(a,b)=x
.

As a reminder, GCD(a,b)
 is the greatest integer that divides both a
 and b
. Similarly, LCM(a,b)
 is the smallest integer such that both a
 and b
 divide it.

It's guaranteed that the solution always exists. If there are several such pairs (a,b)
, you can output any of them.

Input
The first line contains a single integer t
 (1≤t≤100)
  — the number of testcases.

Each testcase consists of one line containing a single integer, x
 (2≤x≤109)
.

Output
For each testcase, output a pair of positive integers a
 and b
 (1≤a,b≤109)
 such that GCD(a,b)+LCM(a,b)=x
. It's guaranteed that the solution always exists. If there are several such pairs (a,b)
, you can output any of them.

You are given three positive (i.e. strictly greater than zero) integers x
, y
 and z
.

Your task is to find positive integers a
, b
 and c
 such that x=max(a,b)
, y=max(a,c)
 and z=max(b,c)
, or determine that it is impossible to find such a
, b
 and c
.

You have to answer t
 independent test cases. Print required a
, b
 and c
 in any (arbitrary) order.

Input
The first line of the input contains one integer t
 (1≤t≤2⋅104
) — the number of test cases. Then t
 test cases follow.

The only line of the test case contains three integers x
, y
, and z
 (1≤x,y,z≤109
).

Output
For each test case, print the answer:

"NO" in the only line of the output if a solution doesn't exist;
or "YES" in the first line and any valid triple of positive integers a
, b
 and c
 (1≤a,b,c≤109
) in the second line. You can print a
, b
 and c
 in any order.
